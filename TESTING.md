# Testing
This repository contains a PHPUnit testing script, but it might not be evident to use this file. The basic usage is to run this script using a command like the following (where `MAGENTO` is your own Magento 2 installation):

    phpunit -c phpunit-yireo.xml --bootstrap MAGENTO/dev/tests/unit/framework/bootstrap.php
